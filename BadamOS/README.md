# BadamOS |  Ascii UI Iranian Operating System 
----------------------------------------------
**BadamOS** is a lightweight, modular operating system written in C# using the [Cosmos](https://gocosmos.org/) framework.  
It is designed as an IRANIAN(I love my country) Operating System, terminal emulation, and working on a custom programming language called **Badamshakan** that coming soon.

---

## 🌰 Badam Features

- **Pure C# Kernel** based on Cosmos
- **Modular ASCII UI System** (`UI` With ascii charatcers instead of VGA)
- **Custom Scripting Language**: `Badamshakan(not now)`
- **Support for visual elements**: Buttons, Inputs, Texts, Frames
- **Structured Element System**: Customizable and extensible
- **Simple pseudo-GUI simulation** in the console environment

---

## 💻 Display System

BadamOS uses a simple objective method design for output:

```text
UI.Element button  = new UI.Element;
button.type  = "button";
button.text = "Button";
```
## 🔨 BadamShakan 

BadamOS is making a Single-Platform Programming language named **BadamShakan**. This Programming language is some diffrent with normal programming standards like when you want you type **Hello World** in python is like this :  
`print("Hello World")`
But in BadamShakan :  
`Show("Hello world ")`
And if you want to show this text on a ascii window :  
`Display(Show("Hello World"))`
